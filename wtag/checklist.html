		<h1>[DRAFT] Web Technology Accessibility Guidelines Checklist</h1>
		<p>This is a draft checklist to support <a href="wtag.html">Web Technology Accessibility Guidelines (WTAG)</a> prepared by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/">Protocols and Format Working Group</a> and expected to be continued by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a>. The goal of WTAG is to describe the features that web technologies should provide to ensure it is possible to create content that is accessible to users with disabilities. The full Web Technology Accessibility Guidelines references an analysis of user requirements and provides comprehensive guidance to technology developers. This checklist extracts that information at a high level to aid in self-review of technologies. Specification developers can use this to help ensure the technology will address features likely to be raised during horizontal review from accessibility proponents.</p>
		<p>Web technologies address a variety of needs, and very few technologies are intended to address all situations. This checklist is organized by types of features that a technology may provide. If the technology provides such a feature, the checklist items under the heading are applicable and should be examined. If the technology does not provide such a feature, the checklist items under the heading are not applicable and can be passed over.</p>

				<li>When providing presentational semantics, they can be easily mapped to structural semantics, e.g., to support restyling or meaningful exposure to AAPIs. </li>
				<li>Support a comprehensive set of authoring use cases to minimize the need for alternative content. (e.g., don't make authors resort to text in images to get the style they want).</li>
				<li>Semantics allow precise and replicable location information in the document to be deteremined.</li>

				<li>For user interface objects that can have states, properties, or values, authors can set these and these can be exposed to AAPIs. </li>
				<li>When providing imperative mechanisms to implement technology features (e.g., scripts), authors can expose accessibility information to AAPIs. </li>

		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>If technology defines accessible alternative features</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Accessible alternatives themselves meet the same bar of accessibility.<ul>
